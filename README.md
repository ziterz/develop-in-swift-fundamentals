# Publisher Description
In this course, students build fundamental iOS app development skills. They’ll master the core concepts and practices of the Swift programming language that developers use daily and build a basic fluency in Xcode’s source and UI editors. Students will dive into the UIKit framework to create iOS apps that adhere to standard practices, including use of stock UI elements and layout techniques, and common navigation interfaces. They’ll also embark on an app design journey, using the App Design Workbook to define, prototype, and test their own app idea.


Guided app projects help students build an app in Xcode with step-by-step instructions and illustrations. Some projects include starter code, allowing students to focus on key concepts to accelerate learning. They'll also learn key programming concepts in Xcode Playgrounds—interactive coding environments that let them experiment with Swift code to see results immediately.
